# Product Brief: SpriteShift AI

## 1. Overview

**Product Name:** SpriteShift AI

**One-Liner:** An AI-powered platform that transforms static character art into animated, game-ready sprites.

**Problem Statement:** Creating 2D character animations is a major bottleneck for game developers. It is a time-consuming, expensive, and skill-intensive process that often slows down or halts indie and hobbyist game development projects.

**Solution:** SpriteShift AI offers a simple, fast, and affordable web-based tool that automates the animation process. By uploading a single static image of a character, developers can generate a full set of high-quality fighting game animations in minutes, not weeks.

## 2. Target Audience

Our primary market consists of individuals and small teams who have a creative vision but may lack the resources for professional animation.

-   **Primary Audience: Indie Game Developers**
    -   Small teams or solo developers building commercial games.
    -   They value speed, efficiency, and tools that integrate easily into their workflow (e.g., Godot, GameMaker).
    -   They are willing to pay for tools that solve a significant pain point and offer a clear return on investment.

-   **Secondary Audience: Hobbyists & Game Jam Participants**
    -   Individuals creating games for fun, learning, or competitions like game jams.
    -   They are often budget-constrained and require a free or low-cost entry point.
    -   They are an important part of the community and can act as brand evangelists.

## 3. Core Features (MVP)

The Minimum Viable Product will focus on delivering the core value proposition with a standard set of features:

-   **Single Image Upload:** Users can upload a single `.png` or `.jpg` file of their character.
-   **Automated AI Pipeline:** The backend processes the image through background removal, pose analysis, and animation generation.
-   **Standard Animation Set:** The MVP will generate a set of 10 essential animations: `idle`, `walk_forward`, `walk_backward`, `jump`, `light_punch`, `heavy_punch`, `light_kick`, `heavy_kick`, `take_damage`, and `knocked_out`.
-   **Standard Output Format:** Animations are delivered as a single sprite sheet (`.png`) and a metadata file (`.json`) containing frame timings and hitbox data.
