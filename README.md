# SpriteShift AI

SpriteShift AI is an in-development tool that transforms user-provided art or stickers into game-ready, animated characters for a 2D fighting game.

## Overview

This tool uses a pipeline of modern AI models to turn custom art into playable sprites. Users can upload a character image, and the system will automatically process it, generating a character with a full set of animations for battling in a classic arcade-style fighting game.

This repository contains the full product and engineering documentation, architectural diagrams, and sample code to guide the development of the SpriteShift AI platform.

## Core Features (Planned)

-   Upload a single static image of a character.
-   AI pipeline removes the background and prepares the sprite.
-   Generates a standard set of fighting game animations (e.g., idle, punch, kick, jump).
-   Automatically derives hitboxes from rendered frames.
-   Outputs sprite sheets and animation data for easy integration into game engines like Godot.

## Risks and Mitigations

This is a complex project with several risks. Here is a summary of high-risk items and mitigation strategies:

-   **High Risk: Animation Quality & Artifacts**
    -   **Description:** The AI models may produce animations with visual artifacts, unnatural movements, or inconsistencies, leading to a poor user experience.
    -   **Mitigation Steps:**
        1.  **Post-processing:** Implement filters to clean up generated frames.
        2.  **Parameter Tuning:** Allow users to tweak generation parameters (e.g., motion intensity) to influence the outcome.
        3.  **"Best-of-N" Generation:** Generate multiple animation variants and let the user choose the best one.
        4.  **Model Refinement:** Continuously fine-tune the underlying animation models with curated datasets to improve quality.

-   **High Risk: User Copyright Claims**
    -   **Description:** Users may upload copyrighted material they do not own, exposing the platform to legal challenges and DMCA takedown requests.
    -   **Mitigation Steps:**
        1.  **Clear Terms of Service:** The EULA will require users to affirm they have the rights to all uploaded content.
        2.  **DMCA Takedown Policy:** Establish and publish a clear process for copyright holders to submit takedown notices.
        3.  **Automated Scanning:** While not foolproof, use perceptual hashing (pHash) to check uploaded images against a database of known copyrighted material.
        4.  **Moderation Queue:** Implement a system for human review of flagged content.
